# Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

1. Run the main function with the format (model, batchsize, learning_rate, num_epoch).

   1. Choose the model you would like to use from below. net = Net(),  LeNet_5 = LeNet(),  AlexNet_8 = AlexNet(),  VGG_16 = VGG1(), VGG_19 = VGG2(), NiN = NiNet(), ResNet_18 = ResNet1(), ResNet_34 = ResNet2(). 
2. 'batchsize' is the batch size in training process. 
3. 'learning_rate' is learning rate of the optimizer.
4. 'num_epoch' is the number of epochs you would like to train.
